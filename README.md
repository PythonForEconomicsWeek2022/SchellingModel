### How to work in this repo
- Name your file schelling_project_<Name>.ipynb Don't overwrite other people's files. 

 
### Working with Github 
To "download" the repo, use git clone <repo_link>. This downloads the repo to a specific folder in your local machine. We only need to do this once.
  
1. Before we start working on our project, make sure that you have the latest copy from Github (git pull) 
2. When you have completed a chunk of code that you think is worthy enough to be "uploaded" to Github, do the following: 
  1. git add -A 
  2. git commit -m "<Some description of what you have done>" 
  3. git push 
Github desktop simplifies this for you, but essentially these are the 3 steps that it is doing.
